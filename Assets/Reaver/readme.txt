Author's description:

This pack has all 17 cursor roles based on Jett's Kunai from Valorant. This is the first cursor pack I made partly with Blender, though I did not make the Kunai model.

All of these are either animated or glowing (and I added the Suppressed animation from KAY/O for Unavailable cuz why not)
